Some features:

User Accounts: User signin/signup was implemented with express-session. The bcrypt software library was used for secure hashed passwords. Users have several exclusive features available to them, including posting, as well as liking, editing, and deleting posts. Much of the functionality on the site needs an account to access, although posts can still be viewed without an account. Login status is tracked with the sidebar, which displays the username if someone is logged in and displays a signin button if someone is logged out.

URLS: '/signin' and '/signup' anybody can access, even someone logged in. Navigating to these pages as someone logged in will however send you to the signout endpoint. '/signout' will logout the current user

Text Post Generation: After a user has signed in, they can navigate to the /makeposts page with the url or the nav bar. There is a text
box where one can generate a post of 100 chars or less, and a submit button which will upload the post and redirect the user to the page
with their posts, where the new post will be viewable. 
URL: '/makepost' needs an account

Text Post Viewing: The text posts can be viewed from urls '/' and '/yourposts'. The '/yourposts' url needs a signed in user to access, otherwise the user will be redirected to the signin page. Posts are divided into pages, with 5 posts per page. To navigate between pages, "previous" and "next" links are at the bottom of the page as needed. The first page will only have a next url, and the final page will only have a previous(unless all posts are on one page, then no link will be there as there is only a single page). The posts will, by default, be ordered by how recently they were posted, in descending order. So most recent posts are on top by default. There is a dropdown which, when changed, will resort the posts based on the value. Post ordering is not preserved between pages. If one is using the liked post view on page 1 and navigates to page 2, the recent post view will be enabled again, and the liked post view will need to be manually chosen. Any users, logged in or anonymous, can view all posts. 
URL: '/' and '/yourposts' the second needs an account

Post Liking: Logged in users have access to the like mechanism. There is a like button displayed for all posts, which logged in users can use to give a post a like. Upon clicking "like", a post's like count will be increased, both visually and in the database. Liking/displaying new post likes does not reload the page, as it is done with fetch. 
No url needed to access(in server it is '/posts/likepost')

Post Editing: Users who are logged in have the ability to edit their own posts. Only posts generated by the user can be edited, not those by other users. Editing is done by using a form with a textarea and submit button, which replaces the post content and other buttons when the edit button is clicked. Upon submitting the edit, the post will look as it did before, but with the additional/updated content. Editing does not reload the page.
No url needed to access(in server it is '/posts/updatepost')

Post Deletion: Users who are logged in have the ability to delete their own posts. Only posts generated by the user can be deleted, not those by other users. Deleting is done by clicking a button, which will delete the post from the database and the display. Deleting does not reload the page. 
No url needed to access(in server it is '/posts/updatepost')

Trending Box: On the pages displaying posts, there is an additional box which shows up to 3 trending posts. This is done by using the result of a select query and dynamically generating the box rows. 
No specific url, part of the viewing posts

Account Statistics: If a user is logged in, the sign in button is replaced by an account button displaying the username of the user that is logged in. Upon clicking this button, the user will be brought to a page showing the number of likes their account has. 
URL: '/account' needs an account to access
